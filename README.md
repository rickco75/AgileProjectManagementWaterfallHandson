# Quizdom

## Executive Summary

*The purpose of Quizdom is to create a Jeopordy like gameshow that will allow multiple players to interact at the same time using various technologies.* 

*This document will explain to you the basic flow of the project a.k.a Quizdom as well as technical details for how the project will be built*

## Business Objectives

*Quizdom is important because it will allow people all over the internet to play a game that also involves learning various subjects that can be used for fun or for a more formal learning environment.*

## Background

*Quizdom is being initiated to fulfil the final group project for Coder Camps*

## Scope

*Quizdom includes the ability for users to view pre-defined questions as well as create their own questions.  It also allows for advanced features such as editing their questions and keep track of their game metrics*

## Functional requirements
*Quizdom consists of many moving parts and many different technologies. To start with the entire project is based inside of a .net framework.  The front end is all HTML5, JAVASCRIPT and ANGULAR JS WITH GOOGLE MATERIALIZE. The backend consists of c# with ASP .NET CORE.  SignalR is being used to interact with Websockets technology. Identity server is being used to track user logins which tie a unique user id to all the gaming aspects.  The database is using MySQL which contains many different tables including the user table, game table, quiz/questions table, categories table and players table. 
  The Gameboard consists of a 6X6 grid that is headed by categories that have 2 questions from each of the difficulty levels.  The questions are pulled from the database in random order.*

## Personnel requirements

*The team will consist of two people. One to work on the front end and one to work on the back end. Additional people could be added if necessary. The skill set of each team member must be substantial.*

## Delivery schedule

*The project must be delivered in 6 weeks.  The first week consists of white boarding each individual step in the game. The Second section which covers weeks 2 and 3 is the quiz table and basic management of questions. The final phase of the project is the implementation of the game components.*

## Other requirements

* The site will be responsive meaning it will work on any browser and any screen resolution. Materialize will give it a state of the art feel!*

## Assumptions

*Quizdom will be self reliant therefore eliminating the need to depend on any third party services besides the hosting environment which will be determined by the best priced hosting platform.*

## Limitations

*The cost of the project will depend on how much data in the database. Due to a very small budget the hosting plan will be limited in space and access speed.*

## Risks

*The main risk is involving websockets technology which could push our project out of our time constraints. Other constraints involve hosting platform.*
